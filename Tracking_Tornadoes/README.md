## About this project:
Submission for Microsoft PowerBI DataViz World Championship (2025)

#### Objective:
Create an Infographic style PowerBI dashboard to inform the viewer of the dangers and toll that tornadoes cause: 
<ul>
<li>Identify the main destructive trends</li>
<li>Create a heatmap to show tornado intensity by state</li>
<li>State specific analysis</li>
<li>Time interval trends by year and time of day</li>
</ul>
<br></br>

# Analysis Process:

### Reviewing and Processing the Data:
<ul>
<li>Data was downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website.</li>
<li>Loaded data into Python to exlpore, clean and transform as needed.</li> 
<li>Dataset was filtered for the years of 2000-2022.</li>
<li>Data was then extracted from Python into a CSV file for analysis</li>
<li>Loaded the cleaned dataset into Power BI.</li>
</ul>  
<br></br>

### Overview Insights: 
<b>Online Sales:</b>
With 59% of purchases done online, there is a clear trend towards digital transactions. Contactless and debit card usage could be from in station purchases. 

<b>Utilization of Discount Railcard:</b>
Despite the discount railcard availability, 66% of passengers do not use it. Identifying reasons for low adoption (e.g., awareness, perceived value, eligibility) and implementing targeted marketing or adjustments could boost usage, increasing ticket sales and revenue.

<b>Efficiency Based on Punctuality:</b>
Focusing on maintaining or improving punctuality for the top arrival stations (average 82% on-time) and departure stations (average 89% on-time) can boost customer satisfaction, repeat business, and operational efficiency. Addressing factors for underperforming stations can optimize operations and reduce associated costs.

### Revenue Recommendations:
<b> Improve Technical and Staffing Reliability:</b>
Implement a rigorous maintenance schedule to minimize technical issues. Conduct regular training sessions and improve the staffing process to ensure that adequate staff is available, especially during peak times. Invest in better monitoring and early detection systems to quickly address technical problems before they impact service.

<b> Refund/Delays:</b>
Enhance the communication system to inform passengers promptly about weather-related delays and offer alternative options to reduce the impact.
Consider offering flexible rescheduling options rather than refunds to retain revenue.

<b> Ticket Recommendations:</b>
1) Improve the user experience on the online ticketing platform to make it more intuitive and faster.
2) Provide a seamless mobile experience to cater to on-the-go customers.
3) Offer exclusive online discounts or loyalty points to encourage more online purchases.
4) Offer early bird discounts for passengers who book tickets well in advance.
5) Provide additional benefits for advance purchasers, such as seat selection or free Wi-Fi.
6) Railcard: Reevaluate the discount railcard program to understand why it is underutilized. Simplify the process of acquiring and using the discount railcard.
   Promote the benefits of the discount railcard through targeted marketing campaigns.
