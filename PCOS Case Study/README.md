# PCOS: A Case Study Analysis
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder and a leading cause of infertility, affecting millions of women worldwide and characterized by a diverse range of symptoms, both physical and mental.

This case study, conducted in 2023, uses data collected through a Google survey by a team of final-year engineering students. The survey's goal was to gather detailed information on various factors related to PCOS, to aid in the development of a machine learning-based PCOS risk prediction system.

The interactive PowerBI dashboard developed for this project serves as an informative and visually engaging infographic. It not only presents the findings from the data analysis but also aims to educate viewers a little about PCOS and its main symptoms.

# My Analysis Process:

### Reviewing the Data:
<ul>
<li>Reviewed the provided data consisting of one csv file on the Kaggle platform.</li> 
<li>Loaded the working data into a Jupyter notebook for initial cleaning and data preparation.</li>
<li>Power BI for initial data cleaning, formatting, and manipulation which was minimal.</li>
</ul>  
<p>
  
### Processing Data:
<ul>
<li>Reviewed dataset structure and information.</li>
<li>Revised column headings to something shorter.</li>
<li>Changed weight from kilograms to pounds and height from centimeters to inches.</li>
 <li>Dataset was checked for duplicates and null values.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
  
### Dashboard Concept:
<ul>
<li>Outlined key metrics and potential visual ideas.
<li>Designed the overall aesthetic and layout to ensure an informative user-friendly interface.</li> 
<li>The background and icons were designed and exported from PowerPoint.</li>
</ul>
<br></br>


# Dashboard
## Overview Page:
<ul>
<li>Displays general ticket information: quantity, purchase methods, monthly ticket totals, and average price.</li>
<li>Highlights the number of stations covered, with a focus on the top 3 departure and arrival stations, their on-time performance, and revenue.</li>
<li>KPIs and visuals to provide a summary of other key metrics.</li>
</ul>

### Overview Insights: 
<b>Online Sales:</b>
With 59% of purchases done online, there is a clear trend towards digital transactions. Contactless and debit card usage could be from in station purchases. 

<b>Utilization of Discount Railcard:</b>
Despite the discount railcard availability, 66% of passengers do not use it. Identifying reasons for low adoption (e.g., awareness, perceived value, eligibility) and implementing targeted marketing or adjustments could boost usage, increasing ticket sales and revenue.

<b>Efficiency Based on Punctuality:</b>
Focusing on maintaining or improving punctuality for the top arrival stations (average 82% on-time) and departure stations (average 89% on-time) can boost customer satisfaction, repeat business, and operational efficiency. Addressing factors for underperforming stations can optimize operations and reduce associated costs.
